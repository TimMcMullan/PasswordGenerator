## Summary
A 'Homework Assignment' that turned into the experience that made JS *real* to me!  As much as I had worked on learning and earning in JS, this was still a challenge.

## Description
This single page app uses a few inputs from the user to create a password randomly from their selection of criteria.  Their options include:  
&emsp;How long (limited to 8 - 128 characters)  
&emsp;Which character types.  Options include:  
&emsp;&emsp;Capitalized letters  
&emsp;&emsp;Lower-cased letters  
&emsp;&emsp;Special characters (such as *, / and more)  
&emsp;&emsp;Numbers  

There was also error-handling needed to ensure their selections were within the requirements of the program. These include:  
&emsp;The length (number of characters) they requested  
&emsp;Using at least one of the four criteria

## Instructions

Load the page, click the **Generate Password** button, and follow the prompts!!
